  <!--
    The city names are presented to the user in an alphabetically-sorted list with section headers.
    The section header is the "index" of all the cities in the section. By default, the section
    header is the first character of the city name.

    However, in some languages, cities are listed under an incorrect index.

    Should a city be listed under an incorrect index, the correct index can be manually specified
    by adding an index to the translation string before the "=" placeholder:
        <item>[index]<xliff:g id="separator">=</xliff:g>[city name]</item>

        Ex. <item>A<xliff:g id="separator">=</xliff:g>Abidjan</item>
        Now Abidjan will be classified under the "A" index.

    Note that the separator "=" should NOT be localized. The index can be multi-character; it will
    consist of all specified characters before the "=" separator.

    This will NOT change the sort order of the cities list. It will solve issues where a city is
    mistakenly listed under its own index instead of being included in a section immediately
    before or after its listing.
